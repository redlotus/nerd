# About

I am just a lazy and simple man who is readaholic, cyclist. I am interested in taking photo (yeah but not really a photographer, I am not professional to be called like that), travelling using bicycle or motorbike and enjoying my life every moment.

Volunteering is an important part of my life. Sharing is happiness.
