# About

I am just a lazy and simple man who is readaholic, cyclist. I am interested in taking photo (yeah but not really a photographer, I am not professional to be called like that), travelling using bicycle or motorbike and enjoying my life every moment.

Volunteering is an important part of my life. Sharing is happiness.

Keep it simple and short - Unix philosophy -
